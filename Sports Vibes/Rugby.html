<b><u>About Rugby</u></b><br>Rugby is a 15-a-side team sport. The object of the game is to
 ground the ball behind the opponent's try line, into what is called the in-goal area. Rugby is played both with 
the ball in hand and by kicking the ball. However, when the ball is being carried in hand it can only be thrown or handed off backwards.
In sum, rugby—with the exception of The Hunger Games—is the most violent sport ever.
The humble rugby ball, formerly known as a 'quanco', is iconic in the game for its odd shape, completely different to almost every other sport.
 Whilst cricket, football, tennis and more use traditional spheres for their playing equipment, the rugby ball is an 'elongated ellipsoid' or basically oval
 The length of a rugby match is 80 minutes long with two halves of 40 minutes. For decades, rugby matches have been eighty minutes long in the sport,
 allowing time for teams to fully get a mantle.
